# Dashboard & UI Projects

A collection of **Dashboard and UI-focused projects** built with Python, web technologies, and data tools.

This repository showcases example dashboards, mini data apps, and UI prototypes used to explore:
- Visualizing metrics and trends
- Designing clean, usable interfaces
- Connecting front-end UIs to data backends (APIs, databases, DuckDB, CSV/JSON, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice building **interactive dashboards** and **user interfaces**
- Experiment with different **charting libraries**, **layout patterns**, and **components**
- Connect UIs to **real or synthetic data** (CSV, DuckDB, APIs)
- Create small, reusable examples for a future portfolio

## 🧱 Tech Stack (Typical)

Most projects in this repo use some combination of:

**Frontend / UI**
- HTML5, CSS3
- Bootstrap / Tailwind / custom CSS
- JavaScript (vanilla or small frameworks)
- Charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js, Recharts, ECharts, or similar)

**Backend / Data (for data-driven dashboards)**
- Python (Flask / FastAPI) or lightweight APIs
- DuckDB / SQLite / CSV / JSON as data sources
- Pandas for data transformations and aggregation

**Development**
- IntelliJ IDEA / PyCharm / VS Code (any modern IDE)
- Git + GitHub for version control and hosting

> Not every project uses all of these—each subfolder may have its own stack and dependencies.
